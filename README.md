# Ani The Stress Buster

Welcome to **Ani The Stress Buster** — a website designed to help students handle stress in a light, fun, and relaxing way. 

## About This Project

As a student, I understand how overwhelming academic life can get. This website is my **initial step** toward helping myself and others manage stress using simple, soothing tools — right from the browser.

 This is a **personal project and original idea** to support student mental wellness in a fun and interactive way.

##  Features

-  **Motivational Quotes** — Feel inspired anytime!
-  **Relaxing Music** — Lo-fi, nature sounds, and focus beats.
-  **Games** — Classic Tic-Tac-Toe to unwind your brain.
-  **Breathing Exercise** — Simple guided breathing.
-  **Pomodoro Timer** — Stay focused and take mindful breaks.
-  **Mood Tracker** — Coming soon!

##  What’s Next?

This is just the beginning. I’ll be:
- Improving UI/UX based on feedback 
- Adding more games, music options, and interactive tools 
- Exploring integration with calming animations & journaling features 

##  Feedback Welcome!

Your suggestions, ideas, or kind words mean a lot!
